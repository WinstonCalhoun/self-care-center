// Login Page

// Refactor your application so that the user lands on a “Login” page
// The login page should match the style of the application.
// The login page should contain an input for a user to enter their name, and a button to submit.
// After the user clicks the submit button, they should be taken to the main application page, and see a personalized greeting that displays their name and some sort of welcome message.
// The welcome message and name should appear in a logical place of your choosing.
